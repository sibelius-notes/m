**Note**: This term was severely impacted by COVID-19. Classes suspended during the week March 16 to March 20. The last two weeks' lecture
were delivered online. Since there were not in-person exams, almost all the courses have to change the grading scheme.
- SE 350 made their 50% final to be 100 for all students... but sadly not CS 350 since SE doesn't need to comply with the rules of the Faculty of Mathematics. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fky8qw/se_350_automatic_100_on_50_final_cs_350_possible/).
- and... here is [*Guidance for the Faculty of Mathematics Only*](https://uwaterloo.ca/keep-learning/guidance-faculty-mathematics-only)...

**BUT**: Course instructors can elect to use CR or NCR in place of numeric grades for Winter Term 2020. Students **will be able to** ask to convert numeric grades to CR or NCR for a specific period after the end of Winter Term.

Sadly, some jobs' offers were rescined... including some Cali jobs...

Also, [all spring 2020 courses are online now](https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/news/spring-2020-classes-online-only). Unlike in winter 2020, they will plan the course much much better and have a better scheme satisfying everyone.
